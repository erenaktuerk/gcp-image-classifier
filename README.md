GCP ML Image Classifier

Project Overview

The GCP ML Image Classifier project is a machine learning-based image classification system that leverages the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of cloud-based ML services while providing a robust solution for building, training, and deploying machine learning models using GCP’s scalable infrastructure.

This project integrates various GCP services, including Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for storing datasets and AI Platform (Vertex AI) for training and deploying machine learning models. With seamless integration between local development environments and the cloud, this solution is designed to handle large datasets and computationally intensive tasks without compromising performance or efficiency.

Key Features
	•	Google Cloud Integration: Utilizes GCP services such as Google Cloud Storage and AI Platform for a seamless machine learning workflow.
	•	Scalability: The project can scale to handle large datasets and training workloads without requiring local computational resources.
	•	Cloud Storage: Data is uploaded and stored securely in Google Cloud Storage buckets for easy access and scalability.
	•	Model Training on Vertex AI: The model is trained using GCP’s AI Platform (formerly known as AI Hub), leveraging its powerful infrastructure for efficient model training.
	•	Deployment & Monitoring: Once trained, models are deployed directly to Google Cloud for serving predictions, ensuring high availability and ease of monitoring.

Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

To set up and run this project locally and on Google Cloud, ensure that you have the following:
	•	Google Cloud Account: You will need a Google Cloud account and project with access to Vertex AI and Cloud Storage.
	•	Google Cloud SDK: Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. Installation Guide
	•	Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your machine.
	•	Google Cloud Storage Bucket: A GCS bucket to store and retrieve data.
	•	GCP Service Account: A service account with the necessary permissions for accessing AI Platform and Cloud Storage.

Installation Steps
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gcp-ml-image-classifier.git
cd gcp-ml-image-classifier


	2.	Set Up the Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install the Required Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Configure Google Cloud SDK:
Ensure you have set up your Google Cloud SDK and authenticated your session:

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID


	5.	Upload Data to Google Cloud Storage:
Before training the model, you need to upload your dataset to a GCS bucket.

gsutil cp your-local-data.csv gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/data/


	6.	Run Data Preprocessing:
The data preprocessing step splits the dataset into training and validation sets.

python src/data_preprocessing.py


	7.	Train the Model:
You can train the model either locally or by using Vertex AI for cloud-based training. To train locally, run:

python src/train.py

To train on Vertex AI, follow the instructions in the Google Cloud AI Platform documentation to configure a custom training job.

	8.	Deploy the Model to Vertex AI:
Once the model is trained, deploy it to Vertex AI for serving predictions.

gcloud ai models upload --region=your-region --display-name="image-classifier" --artifact-uri=gs://your-bucket/path/to/model


	9.	Making Predictions:
After deployment, use the model endpoint to make predictions:

gcloud ai endpoints predict --region=your-region --endpoint=your-endpoint-id --json-request=your-request.json



Google Cloud Services Utilized
